Development environment for Windows
===================================

The MARTe development environment can be setup in any modern desktop Windows distribution.

For the sake of simplicity these instructions are shown for the Windows 7 distribution but should be easily adaptable to other versions.

Prerequisites
-------------

- `Visual Studio Community 2013 <https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs>`_ or an equivalent version of Visual Studio which contains the cl.exe compiler;
- `GnuWin32 CoreUtils <http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/coreutils.htm>`_;
- `GnuWin32 make <http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm>`_;
- `GnuWin32 sed <http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/sed.htm>`_;
- `Doxygen <http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/coreutils.htm>`_;
- `MigGW <http://www.mingw.org/>`_;

Configuration
-------------

1. Add the folder which contains cl.exe (Usually in ``C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio .../VC/bin``) to the environment PATH variable (Control Panel - System - Advanced system settings - Environment Variables);
2. Add to the PATH environment variable the IDE path (Usually in ``Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio ../Common7/IDE``) which contains the dll libraries for Visual Studio;
3. In the same folder of the compiler cl.exe there should be a script file called vcvars32 (or vcvars64 for the 64 bit compiler), open a console and write ``vcvars32`` setting the variables of Visual Studio environment;
4. Open a cmd console;
5. Type ``vcvars32`` on the console, followed by ``echo %PATH%`` and copy the result to the PATH environment variable (Control Panel - System...);
6. Write on the same console ``echo %INCLUDE%``, add an environment variable called INCLUDE and insert the result there (by Control Panel - System...);
7. Write on the same console ``echo %LIB%``, add an environment variable called LIB and insert the result there (by Control Panel - System...);
8. Install the GnuWin32 and MinGW downloaded above;
9. Add the path which contains the GnuWin32 programs (Usually in ``C:/Program Files (x86)/GnuWin32/bin``) to the PATH environment variable;
10. Add the path which contains the MinGW programs (Usually in ``C:/Program Files (x86)/MinGW/bin``) to the PATH environment variable;
11. Install Doxygen.
