Development environment
=======================

The standard development environment is based on a set of tools which are available in different operating systems, namely Microsoft Windows and Linux.

In order to develop and contribute to the MARTe project you are not constrained to use any of the proposed development environments, provided that the implementation of all the quality rules (coding standard, minimum coverage, ...) is guaranteed.

Nevertheless, the use of the proposed tool-set should facilitate the development and compliance with the development standard.
