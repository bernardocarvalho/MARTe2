Parsers
=======

The core of the framework offers three parsers. 

All the parsers implement the :vcisdoxygencl:`ParserI` interface and are capable of transforming an input stream, encoded in any of the supported languages, into a :vcisdoxygencl:`ConfigurationDatabase`. 

==================================== =======
Type                                 Meaning
==================================== =======
:vcisdoxygencl:`StandardParser`      The :ref:`MARTeConfigurationLanguage`.
:vcisdoxygencl:`XmlParser`           `XML <https://www.w3.org/TR/xml>`_.
:vcisdoxygencl:`JsonParser`          `JSON <https://www.json.org/>`_.
==================================== =======  

.. _MARTeConfigurationLanguage:

MARTe configuration language
----------------------------

The MARTe configuration language has a syntax similar to JSON and is parsed using the :vcisdoxygencl:`StandardParser`. 

The syntax is composed by a tree of name/value pairs separated by an **=** sign. Curly braces are used to define multi-dimensional arrays and to create new named nodes in the tree.

An example of a configuration file using the MARTe language:

.. code-block:: c++

   A = {
      B = 1
      C = "ABCD"
      D = {1, 2, 3, 4}
      E = {"A", "B"}
      F = {
         G = 3.34
         H = {{1, 0, 0}, {0, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 1}}
      }
   }
   
Examples
--------

The following example shows how to parse configuration files in all the supported languages.
