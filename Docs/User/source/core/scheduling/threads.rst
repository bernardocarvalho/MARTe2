Threads and semaphores
======================

The MARTe framework offers a portable API for the management and synchronisation of multi-threaded applications.

.. note::

   The preferred way of using threads is through the :doc:`Services </core/scheduling/services>` interface.

Threads
-------

The :vcisdoxygenns:`Threads` API allows to launch named threads bounded by to a specific CPU affinity (see :vcisdoxygenns:`ProcessorType`) and with a defined amount of stack memory.
The thread priority class and priority level can also be changed for every individual thread.

.. warning::
   
   The change of some of the thread parameters (e.g. priorities) might fail if the user does not have the appropriate operating system permissions. 

.. code-block:: c++

   ...
   void IncrementDecrementFunction(const void * const parameters) {
      ...
   }
   ...
   Threads::BeginThread(&IncrementDecrementFunction, (int64 *)i, THREADS_DEFAULT_STACKSIZE, "NamedThread", ExceptionHandler::NotHandled, 0x1);

.. note::

   When starting a thread, if the affinity parameter is not set, the thread will be allowed to run in the *default* CPU set. The application default CPU set can be changed with  ``ProcessorType::SetDefaultCPUs(...)``

The framework also allows to query the number of threads and its associated properties (see :vcisdoxygencl:`ThreadInformation` and ``Threads::GetThreadInfoCopy``).

Atomic operations
-----------------

The :vcisdoxygenns:`Atomic` API offers a set of portable functions that allow to perform atomic operations, i.e. operations that are guaranteed to be uninterruptible in a multi-threaded application environment. 

.. code-block:: c++
   
   ...
   b = Atomic::Exchange(&a, b);
   ...
   Atomic::Increment(&a);
   ...
   if (!Atomic::TestAndSet(&locked)) {
   
In particular, the ``Atomic::TestAndSet`` functions are used to implement fast polling mutex semaphores (see below) that can be deployed in environments that do not have an operating system scheduler. 

High Resolution Timer
---------------------

The :vcisdoxygenns:`HighResolutionTimer` provides a portable abstraction of a timer and allows to measure *ticks* with high resolution. 

These *ticks* (see ``HighResolutionTimer::Counter()``) can be converted from/into time using the ``HighResolutionTimer::Frequency()`` and ``HighResolutionTimer::Period()`` function.  

.. code-block:: c++

   uint64 countStart = HighResolutionTimer::Counter();
   ...
   while (HighResolutionTimer::Counter() < countEnd);

Sleep
-----

The :vcisdoxygenns:`Sleep` API allows to voluntarily return the control back to the scheduler. The only exception is the ``Sleep::Busy`` which waits for a given time to elapse without yielding the CPU.

.. code-block:: c++

   ...
   MARTe::Sleep::Sec(1e-3);
   ...

Semaphores
----------

The framework offers three distinct sets of portables semaphores:
 
- :vcisdoxygencl:`MutexSem`: mutex semaphore that offers exclusive access to a critical area;
- :vcisdoxygencl:`EventSem`: barrier semaphore that, after being released, allows shared access to a critical area;
- :vcisdoxygencl:`FastPollingMutexSem` and :vcisdoxygencl:`FastPollingEventSem`: mutex and event semaphores that do not require an operating system scheduler. Both work by polling, with atomic operations, a given memory location.

.. code-block:: c++

   ...
   MARTe::MutexSem mutexSem;
   mutexSem.Create(false);
   if(!mutexSem.Lock()){
   ...
   if(!mutexSem.UnLock()){
   ...
   
The event semaphores need the ``Event::Reset`` method to be called in order to lower the barrier. 

.. warning::

   The ``Event::Reset`` operation is not atomic. As consequence, depending on the specific use-case, it may require a mutex semaphore to protect access to a given shared resource while this operating is being performed.
   
.. code-block:: c++

   ...
   MARTe::EventSem eventSem;
   eventSem.Create();
   ...
   mutexSem.Lock();
   if (needsReset) {
      needsReset = false;
      eventSem.Reset();
   }
   mutexSem.UnLock();
   eventSem.Wait();
