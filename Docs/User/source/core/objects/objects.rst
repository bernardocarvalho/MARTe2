Objects
=======

The MARTe2 :vcisdoxygencl:`Object` is the root class of the framework and offers the following features:

- Automatic life cycle management using a smart pointer mechanism (see :doc:`references`);
- Data driven construction (in runtime) using the class name;
- Standard initialisation and configuration interface (more information :doc:`here </core/configuration/configuration>`);
- Standard messaging interface (more information :doc:`here </core/messages/messages>`);
- Allocation on a user selectable heap.

ClassRegistryDatabase
---------------------
   
In order to automatically register a  MARTe Object into the :vcisdoxygencl:`ClassRegistryDatabase`, the following macros must be used:  

- ``CLASS_REGISTER_DECLARATION()`` in the class declaration and;
- ``CLASS_REGISTER(NAME_OF_THE_CLASS)`` in the class definition, where NAME_OF_THE_CLASS is the name of the class where the ``CLASS_REGISTER_DECLARATION()`` has been declared;
   
.. code-block:: c++   

   class ControllerEx1: public MARTe::Object {
   public:
      /**
       * Compulsory for the class to be automatically registered.
       */
      CLASS_REGISTER_DECLARATION()
 
	  ControllerEx1() {	       
      }
      //Any other class methods
      ...    
   };

   //Usually declared in the .cpp unit file.
   CLASS_REGISTER(ControllerEx1, "")   
   
When a MARTe application starts (or when one of the shared libraries is explicitly opened, see the configuration Class= parameter :doc:`here </core/configuration/configuration>` ), these macros will force the relevant class to register in the :vcisdoxygencl:`ClassRegistryDatabase`.   

.. note:: The underlying mechanism is based on the fact that these macros create a :vcisdoxygencl:`ClassRegistryItem` global static variable (per class type) which will then automatically add (i.e. register) itself to the class database (see Add in :vcisdoxygencl:`ClassRegistryDatabase`).

Once the class is registered the database can be queried and new object instances created.   
   
Examples
--------
   
The following examples show how to query the contents of a ClassRegistryDatabase...

... and how to instantiate a new object. Note that the Build method requires as an input an :vcisdoxygencl:`HeapI` implementation (this is particularly useful for embedded systems).
