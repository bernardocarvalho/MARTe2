Components
==========

The `MARTe2-components <https://vcis-gitlab.f4e.europa.eu/aneto/MARTe2-components>`_ repository offers a set of components that are deemed useful to the community. 

These include general purpose GAMs, support to off-the-shelf hardware and interfaces to known supervisory control and data acquisition systems.

It is expected that, driven by project specific use-cases, the community will contribute with new components. This repository abides to the same :doc:`QA </contributing/qa/qa>` standard of the core library.
