Reverse engineering hints for MARTe
===================================

Macros
------

When importing C++ code through a reverse engineering process, EA can not expand the macros, so it will not process functions and classes that contain them.

One approach is to instruct EA to ignore some macros, just adding them to the list of language macros. The only caveat is that functions generated by macros like CLASS_REGISTER will be ignored, too.

Another approach is to sanitise the source code before reverse engineering it with EA. This must be done for macros like NULL_PTR which are usually used as default parameters in function parameters, because in that case EA will signal a syntax error. A plain regex search/replace action can do the job, but remember to not commit the changes or use a dedicated branch, instead.

Macros to add to the EA's list of macros:
· CLASS_REGISTER()
· CLASS_REGISTER_DECLARATION()
· DLL_API

Macros to adapt into source code, preferably on a dedicated branch:
| Macro			| Regex search		| Replacement	| Files
| NULL_PTR()	| NULL_PTR\(.+\*\)	| NULL			| All *.h except "/Core/BareMetal/CompilerTypes.h"
