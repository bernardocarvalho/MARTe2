/**
 * @brief Implementation of a HTTP server.
 * @see MultiClientService.
 *
 * @details Taking advantage of the structure implemented in the MultiClientEmbeddedThread::ThreadLoop method,
 * the ServerCycle function that is executed by all thread in the pool performs the following tasks:\n
 *   Waits on the principal socket for a new client connection.\n
 *   Once a new client is connected, the new socket is created to handle the
 *     specific connection and a new thread is launched with the ServerCycle task to
 *     manage new client connections.\n
 *   The current thread with the new created socket calls the ClientService function to
 *   manage the client HTTP requests.\n
 *   Once the client closes the connection (or in case of errors) the thread terminates.\n
 * @details The client can send a specific HTTP command called TextMode to express that it wants to receive data
 * in text mode (TextMode=1) or in database mode (TextMode=0). If TextMode=1, the HttpService will call the
 * DataExportI::GetAsText of the object found at the path received from the client, or DatExportI::GetAsStructuredData if
 * TextMode=0. In this second case a StructuredDataStream<JsonPrinter> is passed in input to the DatExportI::GetAsStructuredData
 * in order to send to the client data written in json language.
 *
 * @details The HttpService replies to the client always using the HTTP chunked transfer encoding. This allows to stream out
 * data to the socket without knowing a priori the full length of the HTTP message body. In this way we avoid to store the
 * whole body in memory before sending it.
