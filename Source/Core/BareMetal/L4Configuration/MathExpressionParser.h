/**
 * @brief Parser of mathematical expressions in infix form. The expression
 *        can be converted into stack machine form or RPN.
 *
 * @details This class is a concrete class for MARTe::ParserI providing
 *          the actual lexical elements and parsing rules for interpreting
 *          a mathematical expression in infix form.
 * 
 * The parser requires a mathematical expression in the form:
 * 
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * ret = sin(A +B) > ((type)(C+D) * tan((bool)E + (float)15))
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * 
 * @warning Because of a still unsolved bug the expression cannot end
 *          with a string token. Temporary workaround: enclose the
 *          right-hand side between parenthesis if last element is
 *          a variable.
 * 
 * The mathematical expression must be provided to the parser at
 * construction time. The instance of the parser is then bound to that
 * specific expression. 
 * 
 * Constructor requires:
 * @li an input stream of characters containing the mathematical
 *     expression in infix form,
 * @li an output foo structured data, (TODO this is not necessary and will be removed)
 * @li an output stream of characters where the parser will write all
 *     the errors found on the input stream of characters.
 * 
 * To make the parser parse the expression, users should call the Parse()
 * method. Provided that the Parse() method was
 * called, the expression in stack machine form is then availabe as the
 * output of the GetStackMachineExpression() method.
 * 
 * All the instances of the parser use the lexical elements defined
 * in MARTe::MathGrammar and apply the parsing rules of the following
 * grammar:
 *
 * @todo insert grammar here
 *
 * Note: This grammar is written in the SLK language and refers to functions
 * declared in this parser.
